# THUMBWHEEL
A JavaFX thumb-wheel component reproducing the behavior of a mechanical one, where:

- Arrow keys will navigate through the INC/DEC buttons;
- Scroll (mouse wheel or trackpad scroll) when enabled allows to put the cursor over a digit and start scrolling up/down;
- Increment (on top) and decrement (at the bottom) buttons can be coloured differently (e.g. slightly red for increment and slightly blue for decrement);
- Font can be set (e.g. digital one);
- The sign area appears only if minimum is negative. The dash sign when the current value is negative;
- If the current value cannot be represented (e.g. 3 integer digits, maximum equals to 10000, current value set to 1234), `Ã—` is displayed with a different color.
